Description

This is a single page Javascript game that uses Ruby on Rails as an API to store the game data.
In this game you can recruit Units to your team and battle against random enemies.
A team can have a maximum of 3 Units and will always fight with the first unit displayed on the side.
In order to gain strength and fight stronger opponets you must win battles against enemies stronger than you.

How to Use

1. In order to use this application you must first change directories to the backend folder.
2. Then start the rails server with the command "rails s" in the terminal.
3. Once the server is going, open up the 'index.html' file in a web browser.
4. You will now see the game and can start by either creating a new team or loading your previous team with the team id.
5. If you are creating a new team, you must now recruit a unit to fight for you! Press the button labeled 'Recruit a Unit'
6. Once you have a unit, you can now search for an enemy with the 'Find Enemy' button.
7. There are 2 options in a battle, you can either 'Fight' or 'Run'. Pressing fight will have your unit and the enemy attack each other, whereas run will give your unit a chance to escape unharmed.
8. After a battle is over you can: heal your unit with the 'heal' button if you have enough money, search for a new enemy, or recruit another unit to your team (if you can afford it).
9. There is no end to the game, so battle as much as you like :)
